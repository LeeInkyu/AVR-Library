# AVR-Library
A standard Library for AVR, especially for ATmega128 <br>
This headers are include-able for AVR codes <br>
I recommend the usage of <avr/io.h> and such standard headerfiles. <br>
<br>
AVR용 라이브러리들의 묶음입니다. <br>
특히 ATmega128에 최적화되어 있습니다. <br>
아직 학생이고 공부목적으로 제작하였으니, 모자란 점 보시면 마구 기여해주시면 감사합니당 <br>
